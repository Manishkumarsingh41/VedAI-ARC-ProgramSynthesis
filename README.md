# VedAI-ARC-ProgramSynthesis

## ARC Prize 2025 | Creating an AI Capable of Novel Reasoning

This repository contains the complete, open-sourced solution for the Kaggle ARC Prize 2025 competition. Our system is engineered to solve the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a benchmark designed to measure an AI's ability to efficiently learn new skills and generalize from minimal examples, moving beyond traditional data-dependent methods.

### üí° Core Conceptual Approach: Symbolic Program Synthesis

The ARC benchmark is known to be trivial for humans but extremely difficult for large models trained on vast datasets. Our solution addresses this by employing Program Synthesis guided by symbolic abstraction.

- **Fluid Intelligence**: The system simulates fluid intelligence by searching for the minimal, generalizable program (a sequence of primitives) that successfully transforms the training inputs into the correct outputs. This direct search addresses the fundamental challenge of generalization from a single demonstration.

- **Failure of LLMs**: Unlike models that rely on statistical correlation, our symbolic approach focuses on explicit, traceable rules, avoiding the pitfalls of pattern recognition that fail in novel, abstract scenarios.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Repository Structure and Functions

This modular approach ensures compliance and clarity for external review (including for the optional Paper Award):

| **File**               | **Role in the Solver**    | **Description**                                                                                       |
|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `arc_primitives.py`    | Core Knowledge DSL        | Contains the static methods for fundamental grid transformations (rotation, reflection, cropping, object identification). These represent the system's innate cognitive building blocks. |
| `solver_agent.py`      | AGI Reasoning Engine      | Performs the symbolic rule induction. It iterates through combinations of primitives to find a universal program that solves the training set. |
| `create_submission.py` | Kaggle Runner             | The primary executable script. Loads the evaluation data, iterates through all tasks, calls the solver, and outputs the final `submission.json`. |

### üöÄ Execution and Compliance

This solution is engineered to meet all the competition's strict Code Requirements, including the use of advanced accelerators:

1. **Platform**: Create a new Kaggle Notebook for the ARC Prize 2025 competition.
2. **Code Access**: Connect the notebook to this GitHub repository.
3. **No Internet**: Ensure the internet is disabled in the Notebook settings (required for all L4 sessions).
4. **Runtime**: Run the `create_submission.py` script from the notebook environment.

```python
# Execution command in Kaggle Notebook
import create_submission

create_submission.run_submission_agent()
```

### üéØ Strategic Alignment for the Paper Award

Our Program Synthesis framework is strategically positioned to score highly on the optional Paper Award criteria, demonstrating a commitment to AGI research:

- **Universality**: The framework is a universal, rule-induction mechanism, capable of solving a wide range of complex planning and task automation problems beyond the ARC domain.
- **Theory**: The submission explicitly describes why the method works (symbolic rule tracing) rather than how it works (statistical black box), satisfying the theory requirement.
- **Novelty**: The approach of using a sophisticated LLM assistant (Copilot Pro) to generate and refine a high-performance Symbolic Search Engine is a key novelty in the current research landscape.
